Switchseat
==========

What it does:
- You can switch from Gunner/Backseat to pilot's seat --> If you pilot looses connection, simply switch to pilot's seat! 
- Pilot can switch to Back-/Gunnerseat and a AI Pilot will take place as pilot, so you can shoot people from the gunner, even when you are alone. The AI Pilot is controllable with the "," on the NumPad. 

What you CAN do:
- You can either take the switchseat.sqf with a AI Pilot, OR you can use the switchseatNOAI.sqf if you dont want a AI Pilot. Just rename the switchseatNOAI.sqf to switchseat.sqf if you want if.
